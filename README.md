# Weather-Generator

### Purpose:

Displaying the weather in my city using a free weather data API.

### Why?

I haven't particularly used a weather data API before and was curious to play around with a free one to see what's possible.

### Languages:

Node.JS

### API:

Open-Meteo

### Next steps:

- Hosting the site on github pages
- Background animation for night vs. day
- Gifs for each weather type
- Look into any useful extra builds or uses (weather sites and apps have existed for ages but it could be a starting point)
