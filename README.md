# Weather-Generator

### Purpose:

Displaying the weather in my city using a free weather data API.

### Why did I make this?

I haven't particularly used a weather data API before and was curious to play around with a free one to see what's possible and what options there might be. 

### Will I continue with this project?

Since this is a very short project mainly for experimentation and exploration, I may come back from time-to-time to update it. The focus is on understanding the API options and seeing possible applications rather than design or anything else.

### Languages:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### API:

Open-Meteo

### Hosting:

Github Pages 

Note: The objective of this website is to ensure personal ease of access, convenience, and cost-effectiveness. Github Pages, which primarily hosts static sites, was deemed sufficient for the purpose of this project, which is to test the capabilities of a weather API. The API is only called once per page load, and refreshing the page will display updated weather information. While dynamic hosting options could enhance the functionality of the site, it is deemed unnecessary for the scope of this project.

### Demo:

https://mo-tem.github.io/Weather-Generator/ (in progress)

### Next steps / Future Updates:

- Background animation for night vs. day
- Gifs for each weather type
- Look into any useful extra builds or uses (weather sites and apps have existed for ages but it could be a starting point)
