# Weather-Generator

### Purpose:

Displaying the weather in my city using a free weather data API.

### Why did I make this?

I haven't particularly used a weather data API before and was curious to play around with a free one to see what's possible and what options there might be. 

### Will I continue with this project?

Since this is a very short project mainly for experimentation and exploration, I may come back from time-to-time to update it. The focus is on understanding the API options and seeing possible applications rather than design or anything else.

### Languages:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### API:

Open-Meteo

### Demo:

https://mtemkit.github.io/Weather-Generator/ (in progress)

### Next steps:

- Background animation for night vs. day
- Gifs for each weather type
- Look into any useful extra builds or uses (weather sites and apps have existed for ages but it could be a starting point)
